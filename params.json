{"name":"Quickref.el","tagline":"Display relevant notes-to-self in the echo area","body":"# quickref.el\r\n\r\nQuickly record notes for yourself, which can then be displayed back to\r\nyou in the echo area on demand. Notes are organized by topic, and\r\nrelevant notes are typically deduced for you based on context. If your\r\ncurrent major-mode, any of its parents, or any active minor mode is\r\nthe name of a topic, those notes will be considered relevant and\r\ndisplayed to you.\r\n\r\nI use this as an easy way to remind myself of that fancy-new-keybinding\r\nI found last week but can't ever remember when I need it:\r\n\r\n![Example screenshot](https://github.com/pd/quickref.el/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nUse [MELPA](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa): `M-x package-install quickref`.\r\n\r\nLoad it, enable it globally:\r\n\r\n~~~ scheme\r\n(require 'quickref)\r\n(quickref-global-mode +1)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBy default, all actions will be available beneath the prefix `C-c q`. You can\r\nchange this easily:\r\n\r\n~~~ scheme\r\n(setq quickref-command-prefix (kbd \"C-M-q\"))\r\n(quickref-global-mode +1)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYour quickref entries are stored in the file named by `quickref-save-file`,\r\nwhich defaults to `<user-emacs-directory>/quickrefs`. It's probably useful\r\nto keep this file in source control;\r\n[I do](https://github.com/pd/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/quickrefs),\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n1. Guess relevant topics and display their notes in the echo area: `C-c q e`\r\n2. Prompt for a topic and display its notes: `C-u C-c q e`\r\n3. Display notes in a short window at the bottom of the selected window: `C-c q w`\r\n4. Dismiss that window: `C-c q 0`\r\n5. Add a note: `C-c q a`\r\n6. Delete a note: `C-c q d`\r\n7. Save your quickrefs to disk: `C-c q C-s`\r\n8. Reload your quickrefs from disk: `C-c q C-r`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
